## Project Goal

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Installation of dependencies
Run Install npm install OR:
1. Install the Express npm package: `npm install express`.
2. Install the Handlebars npm package: `npm install express-handlebars`.
3. Install MySQL npm package: `npm install mysql2`.
4. Install Meethod-Override npm package: `npm install method-override`.

## Challenges
I got very late in completing my Homework these past weeks.
Several issues arose on my end and I had a little quality time to get these homework correctly completed.
Rendering the final HTML file took me a lot of time to correctly ( I hope) get right.
I did not run the required tests as I was running out of time to complete this.
